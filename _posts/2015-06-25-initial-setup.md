All features of { Personal } are controlled by setting values to variables that
are defined in the `_config.yml` file. Let's start with the initial variables
that you have to set before serving your { Personal } website for the first
time.

### Essential variables

```yaml
# NB! Set your site's url, otherwise stuff will break :)

url: "https://le4ker.github.io"

# If you're hosting your site at a Project repository on GitHub pages
# (https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name)
# and NOT your user repository (https://yourusername.github.io)
# then add in the baseurl here, like this: "/repository-name"
#
# NB! Without this *nothing* will work, because it's used in every path

baseurl: /personal-jekyll-theme
```

The url and baseurl variables are essential, because they are used _everywhere_
where an anchor is defined!

### Coloring

You can define the colors that you want in your { Personal } website by setting
the following variable sin the `_sass/variables.scss` file:

```scss
// Main color
$primary-color: #000;

// Anchor color
$secondary-color: #00cdff;

// Font color
$font-color: #fff;
```

### HTTPS

By default { Personal } will enforce https by javascript redirection. HTTPS is
important because it encrypts the data sent between the client and the server.
If you are hosting on GitHub Pages then it will just work, because your website
will be piggybacking GitHub's certificate. If you are hosting your website in a
server that doesn't have a certificate and you don't want to issue one, then you
can disable this feature by setting the following variable to False:

```yaml
force-https: True
```

### HTML Head

```yaml
lang: "en"
author: "John Smith"
title: "{ John Smith }"
description:
  "Blog and website of John Smith, blogging mainly for tech. Opinions expressed
  are mine."
keywords: "smith, jones, personal, jekyll, theme"
favicon: "/img/favicon.ico"
err-404-img: "/img/labtocat.png"
```

The values that you set, will be placed in the head section of every generated
HTML page.

### Google Analytics

The Google tracking code will be placed in every generated page. If you don't
want Google analytics tracking your website's traffic, set the
google-tracking-id to an empty string.

```yaml
google-tracking-id: "UA-35880426-4"
```

### Serving { Personal }

You can use Docker to run the website to avoid installing any dependencies to
your local environment. To do so, run:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Alternatively, you can run the website locally by installing the dependencies:

```shell
./scripts/install
```

And then start serving the website:

```shell
./scripts/serve
```

That's it!

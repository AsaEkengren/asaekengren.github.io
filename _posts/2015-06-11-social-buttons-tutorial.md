Social buttons (rendered above the footer) are great for having a small hub with
all your social footprint.

You can edit them with the following variables:

```yaml
social:
  - title: "facebook"
    url: "https://facebook.com/"
  - title: "twitter"
    url: "https://twitter.com/"
  - title: "github"
    url: "https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme"
  - title: "rss"
    url: "/feed.xml"
```

The title selects the desired
[Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) icon and it
shouldn't include the "fa-" prefix.

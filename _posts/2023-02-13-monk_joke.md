A Buddhist monk walks up to a hot dog vendor and says,  
<cite>"Make me one with everything".</cite>  

After a brief chuckle, the vendor makes the hot dog and gives it to the monk, saying  
<cite>"That will be $4 please".</cite>  

After the monk hands over a $10 bill, he finds himself waiting uncomfortably while the vendor does nothing except stare back at him.  

Awkwardly the monk asks,  
<cite>"What about my change?"</cite>  

<cite>"Ah,"</cite> replies the hot dog vendor, <cite>"Change must come from within".</cite>

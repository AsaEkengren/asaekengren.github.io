title: Modifying the Contact

The contact part of the index page contains your email and a text. You can
modify the Contact text from the `contact.html` file and set the email in the
site config:

```yaml
email: "your@email.here"
```

Don't be afraid of email harvesting, write your email properly and the page will
perform javascript obfuscation.

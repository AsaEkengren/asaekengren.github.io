> “People will come to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.”  

> “It is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcotized by technological diversions.”  

> “I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed.”
